    <h1>Analysis of Disease Outbreaks</h1>
    <p>
        This website uses data from <a href="https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/">Project Tycho</a> and several
        data mining algorithms to provide you with results that may be helpful in preventing outbreaks
        of disease. Click on one of the data mining tasks in the navigation bar above to start exploring
        the data.<br>
        The different data mining tasks are described below:
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Aaron's Thing</h3>
    <p>
        Hey Aaron, put a little description here.
    </p>
    <h3>Association Rule Mining</h3>
    <p>
        This data mining task finds rules in the data of the form X -> Y where X and Y are different sets of
        diseases. These rules say that areas that experience outbreaks of diseases in X tend to also
        experience outbreaks of diseases in Y in a similar time frame. For example, US states that
        have outbreaks of influenza and typhoid fever in a year also tend to have an outbreak of scarlet fever
        that year.<br>
        This task takes two parameters which are restrictions on the rules that can be included in the results.
        The first is minimum support. This is the lower bound on the ratio of data points
        (time, location combinations) that experienced outbreaks of diseases in all diseases
        in X and Y to the total number of data points. This limits the returned rules to ones that occur
        with some frequency. The second parameter is minimum confidence and this limits results to rules
        that have some level of accuracy. This is the lower bound on the proportion of data points with
        outbreaks of all the diseases in X that also have outbreaks of all the diseases in Y.
